# challenge-2_portfolio

#Description:
This project was me creating a portfolio for my second challenge. The purpose is to allow employers to see my work and potentialy hire me. This solves the problem of, 1. not having a portfolio for my projects and 2. allows for easier acces to my portfolio then by paper. On this porject I learned more about padding space and margin space.

#Usage:
The intended use for this page is simply to have a easy to access location with contact information and past projects for potential employers.
