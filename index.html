        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is James and I am currently learn coding. I am a junior web developer. I hope to one day work with back-end coding as it has interested me since I was a kid. My main draw to coding was videogame designing which later on turned into a more broader interest into coding as a whole. </p>
